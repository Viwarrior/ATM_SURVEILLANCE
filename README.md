# ATM_SURVEILLANCE
The project uses an automatic teller machine (ATM) monitoring system, which is an intelligent system based on embedded technology and combines various video sensors to continuously monitor its environment to detect suspicious activities, such as physical attacks that may endanger security , fraud and theft to the security guard and people using ATMs. It also discusses safety and security measures that could be implemented through appropriate surveillance to prevent such attacks. This project looks at the different forms of physical attacks on ATMs and discusses methods for detecting intrusions, initiating proactive measures, and alerting officials through the GSM network. We also discussed the implementation of the proposed system, sensors, and other supporting hardware for the implementation of the system. The proposed system effectively improves the security of ATMs to prevent impending attacks.
